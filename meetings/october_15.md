# Meeting - 15 September 2025

## Progress report

- Started testing parallel-iterator lab. I'll submit a feedback report later this week.
    - So far: the function generics are quite annoying.

- Ask Tom: I noticed my hours aren't getting approved in Workday, and that MyCSE shows my research position as "pending".
    Sorry for not taking more initiative. Did I overlook something from the job setup process?
